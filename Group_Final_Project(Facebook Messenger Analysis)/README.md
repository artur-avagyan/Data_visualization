The goal of our project was to obtain interactive visualizations of the analytics of the group chat of the messenger. It was a little tricky because the data was in JSON format, so we had to manipulate the data to get the information. One of the big problems were reactions and emojis, as they were encoded and there was no way to extract and analyze them, so we manually chose which ones to extract. Another problem was language because our data also contained messages (and names of participants) in Armenian, so in order to study the content of messages, we had to convert Armenian letters to Latin.<br>
In general, the process was very interesting and we learned how to extract useful information from files in JSON format, make interesting visualizations and dashboards. For further analysis, we can extract more interesting information from the JSON file and make more interactive and interesting visualizations.<br>


| **Story**<br>What’s the problem?<br>What question do you want to answer?<br>Why did you choose it?<br>What is the context?  | Our goal is to get an interactive dashboard that represents messenger group chat analytics. It will be interesting for us and also can be used by others. We will analyze the behavior of people in group chat. |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Audience**<br>Who is going to use the viz? | First of all our classmates, but also can be used by everyone who uses messenger. |
| **Data**<br>What type of data do you have?<br>Where is it stored?<br>Is it static or changing? | Data can be downloaded from facebook(as JSON file). Data is static. |
| **Tools<**br>What tool(s) are you going to use?<br>Why did you choose it? | json, pandas, numpy, plotly, re, dash and html packages. <br>We will these packages use to get convenient data and visualizations.|
| **Charts**<br>What types of charts are chosen?<br>Why are they the best to answer the question posed?<br>Any real alternatives? |Bar charts, line charts, boxplots, scatterplots and so on. Mainly questions will be who does that action the most and comparison of different members' acts.|
| **Originality**<br>Describe any related work that was done with the data. How is your approach original? | There are some analytics tools available but we are going to make it interactive and do deeper analysis |
| **Steps**<br>List the steps you will implement (by each team member) | We haven’t divided steps by each member because we are going to do the project together(with zoom or offline meetings) |
